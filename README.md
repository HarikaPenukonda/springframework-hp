## Annotations
1. Components - create the object and registers that object in Spring IOC container
2. ComponentScan - Scans the base packages and if Component annotation is found it creates and registers the object in the IOC container
3. Configuration - Marks that particular class as a configuration file where the container reads the file and creates, registers, and manages spring beans
4. Bean - This annotation is used to create spring bean
5. Autowired - automatically wires the vales to their respective dependencies, automatic dependency injection
6. Value - This annotation is used to inject values into fields, method parameters, and constructor arguments
7. Primary - designates a bean as the default candidate when there are multiple beans of the same type exist
8. Qualifier - Provides more granular control by specifying which bean should be implemented when multiple beans are available. Qualifier > Primary
9. PropertySource - used in the config file to provide the location of the properties file
10. Required - when the field is marked as required, we need to provide the value otherwise it throws an exception
11. PostConstruct - Runs after the bean is created and dependencies are injected.Used to perform any initialization tasks (e.g., setting up resources).Example: Connecting to a database after the bean is ready.
12. PreDestroy - Runs before the bean is destroyed.Used to perform cleanup tasks (e.g., closing connections or releasing resources).Example: Closing a database connection before shutting down.
13. Controller - Creates the bean of that particular class and stores in the container also indicates that the particular class is a controller.
14. RequestMapping - We Annotate the handler method with this annotation, used to map web requests to specific controller methods. It defines how URLs are handled by the application. Connects HTTP requests (like GET, POST) to specific Java methods in a controller.
Handles requests based on the URL, HTTP method, headers, and more.
15. ResponseBody - Spring annotation that tells the framework to send the method's return value directly in the HTTP response body, instead of rendering a view (like a JSP or HTML page). Converts the return value to a web-friendly format (like JSON, XML, or plain text).
Commonly used for building RESTful APIs where data is sent instead of web pages. ......
